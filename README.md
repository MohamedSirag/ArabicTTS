# Demo Arabic Talk To Speech


This is just a demo reading text in Arabic
and it is not for any use but giving an example of using the ArabicTTS's simple library to convert arabic talking to speech.

it still needs alot of work so if you want to help please do.

Also in order to have this sample/lib running as I've planned for it to run please use only the Google's TTS engine not samsung or any other's. check your TTS settings
